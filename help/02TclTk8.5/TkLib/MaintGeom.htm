<H3><A NAME="M5">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> and <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> make it
easier for geometry managers to deal with slaves whose masters are not
their parents.
Three problems arise if the master for a slave is not its parent:
<P>
<DL>
<DT>[1]<DD>
The x- and y-position of the slave must be translated from the
coordinate system of the master to that of the parent before
positioning the slave.
<P><DT>[2]<DD>
If the master window, or any of its ancestors up to the slave's
parent, is moved, then the slave must be repositioned within its
parent in order to maintain the correct position relative to the
master.
<P><DT>[3]<DD>
If the master or one of its ancestors is mapped or unmapped, then
the slave must be mapped or unmapped to correspond.
<P></DL>
<P>
None of these problems is an issue if the parent and master are
the same.  For example, if the master or one of its ancestors
is unmapped, the slave is automatically removed by the screen
by X.
<P>
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> deals with these problems for slaves
whose masters aren't their parents, as well as handling the simpler
case of slaves whose masters are their parents.
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> is typically called by a window manager
once it has decided where a slave should be positioned relative
to its master.
<B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> translates the coordinates to the
coordinate system of <I>slave</I>'s parent and then moves and
resizes the slave appropriately.
Furthermore, it remembers the desired position and creates event
handlers to monitor the master and all of its ancestors up
to (but not including) the slave's parent.
If any of these windows is moved, mapped, or unmapped,
the slave will be adjusted so that it is mapped only when the
master is mapped and its geometry relative to the master
remains as specified by <I>x</I>, <I>y</I>, <I>width</I>, and
<I>height</I>.
<P>
When a window manager relinquishes control over a window, or
if it decides that it does not want the window to appear on the
screen under any conditions, it calls <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B>.
<B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> unmaps the window and cancels any
previous calls to <B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> for the
<I>master</I>-<I>slave</I> pair, so that the slave's
geometry and mapped state are no longer maintained
automatically.
<B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> need not be called by a geometry
manager if the slave, the master, or any of the master's ancestors
is destroyed:  Tk will call it automatically.
<P>
If <B>Tk_MaintainGeometry</B> is called repeatedly for the same
<I>master</I>-<I>slave</I> pair, the information from the most
recent call supersedes any older information.
If <B>Tk_UnmaintainGeometry</B> is called for a <I>master</I>-<I>slave</I>
pair that is isn't currently managed, the call has no effect.

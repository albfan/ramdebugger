<H3><A NAME="M5">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
These functions are used to set or release a global or
application local grab.  When a grab is set on a particular window
in a Tk application, mouse and keyboard events can only be received by
that window and its descendants.  Mouse and keyboard events for
windows outside the tree rooted at <I>tkwin</I> will be redirected to
<I>tkwin</I>.  If the grab is global, then all mouse and keyboard
events for windows outside the tree rooted at <I>tkwin</I> (even those
intended for windows in other applications) will be redirected to
<I>tkwin</I>.  If the grab is application local, only mouse and
keyboard events intended for a windows within the same application
(but outside the tree rooted at <I>tkwin</I>) will be redirected.

<P>
<B>Tk_Grab</B> sets a grab on a particular window.  <I>Tkwin</I>
specifies the window on whose behalf the pointer is to be grabbed.
<I>GrabGlobal</I> indicates whether the grab should be global or
application local; if it is non-zero, it means the grab should be
global.  Normally, <B>Tk_Grab</B> returns <B>TCL_OK</B>; if an error occurs
and the grab cannot be set, <B>TCL_ERROR</B> is returned and an error message
is left if <I>interp</I>'s result.  Once this call completes
successfully, no window outside the tree rooted at <I>tkwin</I> will
receive pointer- or keyboard-related events until the next call to
Tk_Ungrab.  If a previous grab was in effect within the application,
then it is replaced with a new one.

<P>
<B>Tcl_Ungrab</B> releases a grab on the mouse pointer and keyboard, if
there is one set on the window given by <I>tkwin</I>.  Once a grab is
released, pointer and keyboard events will start being delivered to
other windows again.

<h3> Dropping on windows that do not support XDND </h3>

<p>
Since middle clicking is the universal shortcut for pasting in X, one can drop data into a window that does not support XDND by:

<ol>
<li> After the mouse has been released to trigger the drop, grab ownership of XA_PRIMARY.
<p>
<li> Send a ButtonPress event and then a ButtonRelease event to the deepest subwindow containing the mouse to simulate a middle click.  The times for these events should be the time of the actual button release +1 and +2, respectively.  These values will not be used by anybody else, so one can unambiguously recognize the resulting <tt>XConvertSelection()</tt> request.
<p>
<li> If a request for XA_PRIMARY arrives bearing the timestamp of either the ButtonPress or the ButtonRelease event, treat it as a request for XdndSelection.  Note that you must use the X data types instead of the MIME types in this case.  (e.g. XA_STRING instead of text/plain)
</ol>

Since text is usually the only data that can be pasted into older programs that do not support XDND (e.g. <tt>xterm</tt> and <tt>emacs</tt>), it is a good idea to only use the above trick when dragging text.  As an example, if one drags anything else and fakes a middle click in <tt>xterm</tt>, it will paste the contents of XA_SECONDARY, which is not what the user wants.

<p>
Thanks to <a href="mailto:jvz@cfdrc.com">Jeroen van der Zijp</a> for the idea.

<p>
To get this to work with <tt>xterm</tt>, you must add
<blockquote>
<tt>XTerm.VT100.allowSendEvents: True</tt>
</blockquote>
to your <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> file.

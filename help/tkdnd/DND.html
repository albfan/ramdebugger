<h1><a name="_top"></a>Drag & Drop</h1>
<p>
Drag and Drop is an interactive technique which allows transfer of 
information through a simple metaphor: the user picks an object on 
the display with the pointer, drags it across the screen while 
maintaining the pointer button pressed, and drops the object on some 
other place. Subsequently, the application where the object was 
dropped usually does some data transfer corresponding to the object.
</p><p>
A Drag and Drop operation starts in a window called the source 
window (or simply drag source).
The client owner of this window is called the initiator 
client. The drop operation occurs in a window called the destination 
window (or drop target).
The client owner of this window is called the receiver 
client. A client can be both initiator and receiver for an operation. 
A client can contain both the source and destination windows for an 
operation. The source window may also be the destination window. 
There are no particular requirements on what the client should do or 
not do in those specific cases.
</p><p>
In many cases, the drop will occur on some area called a drop site, 
for example a printer icon or a trash can icon. A drop site may be 
drawn in its own window or may be simply drawn by the receiver 
application in a larger window. The protocol does not require to have 
one window per drop site.
</p><p>
During the drag, both the initiator client and the potential receiver 
clients may want to provide visual feed back to the user. The feed 
back provided by the initiator is called drag-over. The feed back 
provided by a receiver is called drag-under: typically doing some 
animation in the destination window under the drag icon.
<p></p>
The feedback may consist in:
<ul>
<li>an icon representing the data being dragged, called the source icon 
<li>showing the existence of a drop site. Both initiator and receiver might
want to provide feedback whether or not a drop is possible.
For example, the receiver can be highlighting the drop site and the initiator
showing a specific icon: the state icon.
<li>a side effect icon indicating the side effect that would occur if a drop
were made.
<li>In the case where a drop is possible, both initiator and receiver may want
to provide feedback indicating the validity of the operation for this 
particular drop. For example, if it is known that the object being dragged
cannot be processed by the receiver.
</ul>

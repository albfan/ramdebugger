</pre></blockquote><p><b>Important:</b> This interface is <a href="../c3ref/experimental.html">experimental</a> and is subject to change without notice.</p><p>
This API is used to overwrite the contents of one database with that
of another. It is useful either for creating backups of databases or
for copying in-memory databases to or from persistent files.</p>

<p>See Also: <a href="../backup.html">Using the SQLite Online Backup API</a></p>

<p>Exclusive access is required to the destination database for the
duration of the operation. However the source database is only
read-locked while it is actually being read, it is not locked
continuously for the entire operation. Thus, the backup may be
performed on a live database without preventing other users from
writing to the database for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>To perform a backup operation:
<ol>
<li><b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b> is called once to initialize the
backup,
<li><b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b> is called one or more times to transfer
the data between the two databases, and finally
<li><b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b> is called to release all resources
associated with the backup operation.
</ol>
There should be exactly one call to sqlite3_backup_finish() for each
successful call to sqlite3_backup_init().</p>

<p><b>sqlite3_backup_init()</b></p>

<p>The first two arguments passed to <a href="../c3ref/backup_finish.html">sqlite3_backup_init()</a> are the database
handle associated with the destination database and the database name
used to attach the destination database to the handle. The database name
is "main" for the main database, "temp" for the temporary database, or
the name specified as part of the <a href="../lang_attach.html">ATTACH</a> statement if the destination is
an attached database. The third and fourth arguments passed to
sqlite3_backup_init() identify the <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>
and database name used
to access the source database. The values passed for the source and
destination <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a> parameters must not be the same.</p>

<p>If an error occurs within sqlite3_backup_init(), then NULL is returned
and an error code and error message written into the <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>
passed as the first argument. They may be retrieved using the
<a href="../c3ref/errcode.html">sqlite3_errcode()</a>, <a href="../c3ref/errcode.html">sqlite3_errmsg()</a>, and <a href="../c3ref/errcode.html">sqlite3_errmsg16()</a> functions.
Otherwise, if successful, a pointer to an <a href="../c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> object is
returned. This pointer may be used with the sqlite3_backup_step() and
sqlite3_backup_finish() functions to perform the specified backup
operation.</p>

<p><b>sqlite3_backup_step()</b></p>

<p>Function <a href="../c3ref/backup_finish.html">sqlite3_backup_step()</a> is used to copy up to nPage pages between
the source and destination databases, where nPage is the value of the
second parameter passed to sqlite3_backup_step(). If nPage is a negative
value, all remaining source pages are copied. If the required pages are
succesfully copied, but there are still more pages to copy before the
backup is complete, it returns <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_OK</a>. If no error occured and there
are no more pages to copy, then <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_DONE</a> is returned. If an error
occurs, then an SQLite error code is returned. As well as <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_OK</a> and
<a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_DONE</a>, a call to sqlite3_backup_step() may return <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_READONLY</a>,
<a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_NOMEM</a>, <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_BUSY</a>, <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_LOCKED</a>, or an
<a href="../c3ref/c_ioerr_access.html">SQLITE_IOERR_XXX</a> extended error code.</p>

<p>As well as the case where the destination database file was opened for
read-only access, sqlite3_backup_step() may return <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_READONLY</a> if
the destination is an in-memory database with a different page size
from the source database.</p>

<p>If sqlite3_backup_step() cannot obtain a required file-system lock, then
the <a href="../c3ref/busy_handler.html">busy-handler function</a>
is invoked (if one is specified). If the
busy-handler returns non-zero before the lock is available, then
<a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_BUSY</a> is returned to the caller. In this case the call to
sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later. If the source
<a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>
is being used to write to the source database when sqlite3_backup_step()
is called, then <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_LOCKED</a> is returned immediately. Again, in this
case the call to sqlite3_backup_step() can be retried later on. If
<a href="../c3ref/c_ioerr_access.html">SQLITE_IOERR_XXX</a>, <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_NOMEM</a>, or
<a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_READONLY</a> is returned, then
there is no point in retrying the call to sqlite3_backup_step(). These
errors are considered fatal. At this point the application must accept
that the backup operation has failed and pass the backup operation handle
to the sqlite3_backup_finish() to release associated resources.</p>

<p>Following the first call to sqlite3_backup_step(), an exclusive lock is
obtained on the destination file. It is not released until either
sqlite3_backup_finish() is called or the backup operation is complete
and sqlite3_backup_step() returns <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_DONE</a>. Additionally, each time
a call to sqlite3_backup_step() is made a <a href="../lockingv3.html#shared_lock">shared lock</a> is obtained on
the source database file. This lock is released before the
sqlite3_backup_step() call returns. Because the source database is not
locked between calls to sqlite3_backup_step(), it may be modified mid-way
through the backup procedure. If the source database is modified by an
external process or via a database connection other than the one being
used by the backup operation, then the backup will be transparently
restarted by the next call to sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source
database is modified by the using the same database connection as is used
by the backup operation, then the backup database is transparently
updated at the same time.</p>

<p><b>sqlite3_backup_finish()</b></p>

<p>Once sqlite3_backup_step() has returned <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_DONE</a>, or when the
application wishes to abandon the backup operation, the <a href="../c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a>
object should be passed to sqlite3_backup_finish(). This releases all
resources associated with the backup operation. If sqlite3_backup_step()
has not yet returned <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_DONE</a>, then any active write-transaction on the
destination database is rolled back. The <a href="../c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> object is invalid
and may not be used following a call to sqlite3_backup_finish().</p>

<p>The value returned by sqlite3_backup_finish is <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_OK</a> if no error
occurred, regardless or whether or not sqlite3_backup_step() was called
a sufficient number of times to complete the backup operation. Or, if
an out-of-memory condition or IO error occured during a call to
sqlite3_backup_step() then <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_NOMEM</a> or an
<a href="../c3ref/c_ioerr_access.html">SQLITE_IOERR_XXX</a> error code
is returned. In this case the error code and an error message are
written to the destination <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>.</p>

<p>A return of <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_BUSY</a> or <a href="../c3ref/c_abort.html">SQLITE_LOCKED</a> from sqlite3_backup_step() is
not a permanent error and does not affect the return value of
sqlite3_backup_finish().</p>

<p><b>sqlite3_backup_remaining(), sqlite3_backup_pagecount()</b></p>

<p>Each call to sqlite3_backup_step() sets two values stored internally
by an <a href="../c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> object. The number of pages still to be backed
up, which may be queried by sqlite3_backup_remaining(), and the total
number of pages in the source database file, which may be queried by
sqlite3_backup_pagecount().</p>

<p>The values returned by these functions are only updated by
sqlite3_backup_step(). If the source database is modified during a backup
operation, then the values are not updated to account for any extra
pages that need to be updated or the size of the source database file
changing.</p>

<p><b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b></p>

<p>The source <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a> may be used by the application for other
purposes while a backup operation is underway or being initialized.
If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
from within other threads.</p>

<p>However, the application must guarantee that the destination database
connection handle is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after
sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
sqlite3_backup_finish(). Unfortunately SQLite does not currently check
for this, if the application does use the destination <a href="../c3ref/sqlite3.html">database connection</a>
for some other purpose during a backup operation, things may appear to
work correctly but in fact be subtly malfunctioning.  Use of the
destination database connection while a backup is in progress might
also cause a mutex deadlock.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if running in <a href="../c3ref/enable_shared_cache.html">shared cache mode</a>, the application must
guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
that the application must guarantee that the file-system file being
backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().</p>

<p>The <a href="../c3ref/backup.html">sqlite3_backup</a> object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple
threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
possible that they return invalid values.

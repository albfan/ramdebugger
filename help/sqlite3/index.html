<H2>The Tcl interface to the SQLite library</H2>
<P>The SQLite library is designed to be very easy to use from a Tcl or Tcl/Tk 
script. This document gives an overview of the Tcl programming interface.</P>
<H3>The API</H3>
<P>The interface to the SQLite library consists of single tcl command named 
<B>sqlite</B> (version 2.8) or <B>sqlite3</B> (version 3.0). Because there is 
only this one command, the interface is not placed in a separate namespace.</P>
<P>The <B>sqlite3</B> command is used as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>sqlite3</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>dbcmd&nbsp;&nbsp;database-name</I> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The <B>sqlite3</B> command opens the database named in the second argument. 
If the database does not already exist, it is automatically created. The 
<B>sqlite3</B> command also creates a new Tcl command to control the database. 
The name of the new Tcl command is given by the first argument. This approach is 
similar to the way widgets are created in Tk. </P>
<P>The name of the database is just the name of a disk file in which the 
database is stored. </P>
<P>Once an SQLite database is open, it can be controlled using methods of the 
<I>dbcmd</I>. There are currently 18 methods defined:</P>

<P></P>
<P>The use of each of these methods will be explained in the sequel, though not 
in the order shown above.</P><A name=close>
<H3>The "close" method</H3>
<P>As its name suggests, the "close" method to an SQLite database just closes 
the database. This has the side-effect of deleting the <I>dbcmd</I> Tcl command. 
Here is an example of opening and then immediately closing a database: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>sqlite3 db1 ./testdb<BR>db1 close</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you delete the <I>dbcmd</I> directly, that has the same effect as invoking 
the "close" method. So the following code is equivalent to the previous:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>sqlite3 db1 ./testdb<BR>rename db1 {}</B> </BLOCKQUOTE><A 
name=eval>
<H3>The "eval" method</H3>
<P>The most useful <I>dbcmd</I> method is "eval". The eval method is used to 
execute SQL on the database. The syntax of the eval method looks like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>dbcmd</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>eval</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>sql</I> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?<I>array-name&nbsp;</I>?&nbsp;?<I>script</I>? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The job of the eval method is to execute the SQL statement or statements 
given in the second argument. For example, to create a new table in a database, 
you can do this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>sqlite3 db1 ./testdb<BR>db1 eval {CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b 
  text)}</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The above code creates a new table named <B>t1</B> with columns <B>a</B> and 
<B>b</B>. What could be simpler?</P>
<P>Query results are returned as a list of column values. If a query requests 2 
columns and there are 3 rows matching the query, then the returned list will 
contain 6 elements. For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db1 eval {INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,'hello')}<BR>db1 eval {INSERT 
  INTO t1 VALUES(2,'goodbye')}<BR>db1 eval {INSERT INTO t1 
  VALUES(3,'howdy!')}<BR>set x [db1 eval {SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a}]</B> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The variable <B>$x</B> is set by the above code to</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1 hello 2 goodbye 3 howdy!</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>You can also process the results of a query one row at a time by specifying 
the name of an array variable and a script following the SQL code. For each row 
of the query result, the values of all columns will be inserted into the array 
variable and the script will be executed. For instance:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db1 eval {SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a} values 
  {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parray values<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts 
  ""<BR>}</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This last code will give the following output:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>values(*) = a b<BR>values(a) = 1<BR>values(b) = hello
  <P>values(*) = a b<BR>values(a) = 2<BR>values(b) = goodbye
  <P>values(*) = a b<BR>values(a) = 3<BR>values(b) = howdy!</B> </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>For each column in a row of the result, the name of that column is used as an 
index in to array. The value of the column is stored in the corresponding array 
entry. The special array index * is used to store a list of column names in the 
order that they appear. </P>
<P>If the array variable name is omitted or is the empty string, then the value 
of each column is stored in a variable with the same name as the column itself. 
For example: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db1 eval {SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY a} 
  {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "a=$a b=$b"<BR>}</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>From this we get the following output </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>a=1 b=hello<BR>a=2 b=goodbye<BR>a=3 b=howdy!</B> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Tcl variable names can appear in the SQL statement of the second argument in 
any position where it is legal to put a string or number literal. The value of 
the variable is substituted for the variable name. If the variable does not 
exist a NULL values is used. For example: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db1 eval {INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(5,$bigblob)} </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Note that it is not necessary to quote the $bigblob value. That happens 
automatically. If $bigblob is a large string or binary object, this technique is 
not only easier to write, it is also much more efficient since it avoids making 
a copy of the content of $bigblob. </P><A name=complete>
<H3>The "complete" method</H3>
<P>The "complete" method takes a string of supposed SQL as its only argument. It 
returns TRUE if the string is a complete statement of SQL and FALSE if there is 
more to be entered.</P>
<P>The "complete" method is useful when building interactive applications in 
order to know when the user has finished entering a line of SQL code. This is 
really just an interface to the <B>sqlite3_complete()</B> C function. Refer to 
the <A href="http://www.sqlite.org/c_interface.html">C/C++ interface</A> 
specification for additional information.</P><A name=copy>
<H3>The "copy" method</H3>
<P>The "copy" method copies data from a file into a table. It returns the number 
of rows processed successfully from the file. The syntax of the copy method 
looks like this:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>dbcmd</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>copy</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>conflict-algorithm</I> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<I>table-name&nbsp;</I>&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>file-name&nbsp;</I> 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;?<I>column-separator&nbsp;</I>? 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;?<I>null-indicator</I>? </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Conflict-alogrithm must be one of the SQLite conflict algorithms for the 
INSERT statement: <I>rollback</I>, <I>abort</I>, <I>fail</I>,<I>ignore</I>, or 
<I>replace</I>. See the SQLite Language section for <A 
href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html#conflict">ON CONFLICT</A> for more 
information. The conflict-algorithm must be specified in lower case. </P>
<P>Table-name must already exists as a table. File-name must exist, and each row 
must contain the same number of columns as defined in the table. If a line in 
the file contains more or less than the number of columns defined, the copy 
method rollbacks any inserts, and returns an error.</P>
<P>Column-separator is an optional column separator string. The default is the 
ASCII tab character \t. </P>
<P>Null-indicator is an optional string that indicates a column value is null. 
The default is an empty string. Note that column-separator and null-indicator 
are optional positional arguments; if null-indicator is specified, a 
column-separator argument must be specifed and precede the null-indicator 
argument.</P>
<P>The copy method implements similar functionality to the <B>.import</B> SQLite 
shell command. The SQLite 2.x <A 
href="http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html#copy"><B>COPY</B></A> statement (using the 
PostgreSQL COPY file format) can be implemented with this method as:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>dbcmd&nbsp;&nbsp;copy&nbsp;&nbsp;$conflictalgo 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;$tablename&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$filename&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\t&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\\N </BLOCKQUOTE><A name=timeout>
<H3>The "timeout" method</H3>
<P>The "timeout" method is used to control how long the SQLite library will wait 
for locks to clear before giving up on a database transaction. The default 
timeout is 0 millisecond. (In other words, the default behavior is not to wait 
at all.)</P>
<P>The SQLite database allows multiple simultaneous readers or a single writer 
but not both. If any process is writing to the database no other process is 
allows to read or write. If any process is reading the database other processes 
are allowed to read but not write. The entire database shared a single lock.</P>
<P>When SQLite tries to open a database and finds that it is locked, it can 
optionally delay for a short while and try to open the file again. This process 
repeats until the query times out and SQLite returns a failure. The timeout is 
adjustable. It is set to 0 by default so that if the database is locked, the SQL 
statement fails immediately. But you can use the "timeout" method to change the 
timeout value to a positive number. For example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db1 timeout 2000</B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The argument to the timeout method is the maximum number of milliseconds to 
wait for the lock to clear. So in the example above, the maximum delay would be 
2 seconds.</P><A name=busy>
<H3>The "busy" method</H3>
<P>The "busy" method, like "timeout", only comes into play when the database is 
locked. But the "busy" method gives the programmer much more control over what 
action to take. The "busy" method specifies a callback Tcl procedure that is 
invoked whenever SQLite tries to open a locked database. This callback can do 
whatever is desired. Presumably, the callback will do some other useful work for 
a short while (such as service GUI events) then return so that the lock can be 
tried again. The callback procedure should return "0" if it wants SQLite to try 
again to open the database and should return "1" if it wants SQLite to abandon 
the current operation. <A name=last_insert_rowid>
<H3>The "last_insert_rowid" method</H3>
<P>The "last_insert_rowid" method returns an integer which is the ROWID of the 
most recently inserted database row.</P><A name=function>
<H3>The "function" method</H3>
<P>The "function" method registers new SQL functions with the SQLite engine. The 
arguments are the name of the new SQL function and a TCL command that implements 
that function. Arguments to the function are appended to the TCL command before 
it is invoked.</P>
<P>The following example creates a new SQL function named "hex" that converts 
its numeric argument in to a hexadecimal encoded string: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>db function hex {format 0x%X} </B></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=onecolumn>
<H3>The "onecolumn" method</H3>
<P>The "onecolumn" method works like "eval" in that it evaluates the SQL query 
statement given as its argument. The difference is that "onecolumn" returns a 
single element which is the first column of the first row of the query 
result.</P>
<P>This is a convenience method. It saves the user from having to do a 
"<TT>[lindex&nbsp;...&nbsp;0]</TT>" on the results of an "eval" in order to 
extract a single column result.</P><A name=changes>
<H3>The "changes" method</H3>
<P>The "changes" method returns an integer which is the number of rows in the 
database that were inserted, deleted, and/or modified by the most recent "eval" 
method.</P><A name=total_changes>
<H3>The "total_changes" method</H3>
<P>The "total_changes" method returns an integer which is the number of rows in 
the database that were inserted, deleted, and/or modified since the current 
database connection was first opened.</P><A name=authorizer>
<H3>The "authorizer" method</H3>
<P>The "authorizer" method provides access to the sqlite3_set_authorizer C/C++ 
interface. The argument to authorizer is the name of a procedure that is called 
when SQL statements are being compiled in order to authorize certain operations. 
The callback procedure takes 5 arguments which describe the operation being 
coded. If the callback returns the text string "SQLITE_OK", then the operation 
is allowed. If it returns "SQLITE_IGNORE", then the operation is silently 
disabled. If the return is "SQLITE_DENY" then the compilation fails with an 
error. </P>
<P>If the argument is an empty string then the authorizer is disabled. If the 
argument is omitted, then the current authorizer is returned.</P><A 
name=progress>
<H3>The "progress" method</H3>
<P>This method registers a callback that is invoked periodically during query 
processing. There are two arguments: the number of SQLite virtual machine 
opcodes between invocations, and the TCL command to invoke. Setting the progress 
callback to an empty string disables it.</P>
<P>The progress callback can be used to display the status of a lengthy query or 
to process GUI events during a lengthy query.</P><A name=collate>
<H3>The "collate" method</H3>
<P>This method registers new text collating sequences. There are two arguments: 
the name of the collating sequence and the name of a TCL procedure that 
implements a comparison function for the collating sequence. </P>
<P>For example, the following code implements a collating sequence called 
"NOCASE" that sorts in text order without regard to case: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>proc nocase_compare {a b} {<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 
  [string compare [string tolower $a] [string tolower $b]]<BR>}<BR>db collate 
  NOCASE nocase_compare<BR></B></BLOCKQUOTE><A name=collation_needed>
<H3>The "collation_needed" method</H3>
<P>This method registers a callback routine that is invoked when the SQLite 
engine needs a particular collating sequence but does not have that collating 
sequence registered. The callback can register the collating sequence. The 
callback is invoked with a single parameter which is the name of the needed 
collating sequence.</P><A name=commit_hook>
<H3>The "commit_hook" method</H3>
<P>This method registers a callback routine that is invoked just before SQLite 
tries to commit changes to a database. If the callback throws an exception or 
returns a non-zero result, then the transaction rolls back rather than 
commit.</P><A name=errorcode>
<H3>The "errorcode" method</H3>
<P>This method returns the numeric error code that resulted from the most recent 
SQLite operation.</P><A name=trace>
<H3>The "trace" method</H3>
<P>The "trace" method registers a callback that is invoked as each SQL statement 
is compiled. The text of the SQL is appended as a single string to the command 
before it is invoked. This can be used (for example) to keep a log of all SQL 
operations that an application performs. </P>

Snit has been designed and implemented from the very beginning by
William H. Duquette.  However, much credit belongs to the following
people for using Snit and providing me with valuable feedback: Rolf
Ade, Colin McCormack, Jose Nazario, Jeff Godfrey, Maurice Diamanti,
Egon Pasztor, David S. Cargo, Tom Krehbiel, Michael Cleverly, and
Andreas Kupries.

<H3><A NAME="M4">ARGUMENTS</A></H3>
<DL>
<P><DT><A HREF="../TclLib/Interp.htm">Tcl_Interp</A> <B>*interp</B> (in)<DD>
Tcl interpreter from which file handle is to be obtained.
<P><DT>CONST char <B>*string</B> (in)<DD>
String identifying channel, such as <B>stdin</B> or <B>file4</B>.
<P><DT>int <B>write</B> (in)<DD>
Non-zero means the file will be used for writing, zero means it will
be used for reading.
<P><DT>int <B>checkUsage</B> (in)<DD>
If non-zero, then an error will be generated if the file wasn't opened
for the access indicated by <I>write</I>.
<P><DT>ClientData <B>*filePtr</B> (out)<DD>
Points to word in which to store pointer to FILE structure for
the file given by <I>string</I>.
<P></DL>
<H3><A NAME="M5">DESCRIPTION</A></H3>
<B>Tcl_GetOpenFile</B> takes as argument a file identifier of the form
returned by the <B><A HREF="../TclCmd/open.htm">open</A></B> command and
returns at <I>*filePtr</I> a pointer to the FILE structure for
the file.
The <I>write</I> argument indicates whether the FILE pointer will
be used for reading or writing.
In some cases, such as a channel that connects to a pipeline of
subprocesses, different FILE pointers will be returned for reading
and writing.
<B>Tcl_GetOpenFile</B> normally returns TCL_OK.
If an error occurs in <B>Tcl_GetOpenFile</B> (e.g. <I>string</I> didn't
make any sense or <I>checkUsage</I> was set and the file wasn't opened
for the access specified by <I>write</I>) then TCL_ERROR is returned
and the interpreter's result will contain an error message.
In the current implementation <I>checkUsage</I> is ignored and consistency
checks are always performed.
<P>
Note that this interface is only supported on the Unix platform.
